## Overview

The Peaka Partner API uses API keys to authenticate requests.

There are two types of API keys:
- **Partner API Key**: Used to authenticate requests that require partner-level access
- **Project API Key**: Used to authenticate requests that require project-level access

Authorization headers are used to pass the API key in the request. The API key is passed as a Bearer token in the format
`Authorization : Bearer <API Key>`.
