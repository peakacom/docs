## Overview

The Peaka Partner API uses API keys to authenticate requests.

There are two types of API keys:
- **Partner API Key**: Used to authenticate requests that require partner-level access
- **Project API Key**: Used to authenticate requests that require project-level access

Project API keys can access only the resources associated with the project they are created for. Partner API keys can access all resources.

Authorization headers are used to pass the API key in the request. The API key is passed as a Bearer token in the format
`Authorization : Bearer <API Key>`.
