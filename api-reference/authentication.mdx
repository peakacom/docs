## Overview

The Peaka Partner API uses API keys for authentication.

There are two types of API keys:

- **Partner API Key**: Grants access to all resources for partner-level access. [Learn how to manage a Partner API Key](/how-to-guides/how-to-manage-partner-api-key)
- **Project API Key**: Grants access to resources specific to the project for which the key was created. [Learn how to generate API Keys](/how-to-guides/how-to-generate-api-keys)

While **Project API Keys** are restricted to project-specific resources, **Partner API Keys** provide broader access across all available resources.

## Authentication

To authenticate requests, include the API key in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token. The format is as follows:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <API Key>
