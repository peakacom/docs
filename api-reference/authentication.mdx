## Overview

The Peaka Partner API uses API keys for authentication.

There are two types of API keys:

- **Partner API Key**: Grants access to all resources for partner-level access. [Learn how to manage a Partner API Key](/how-to-guides/how-to-manage-partner-api-key)
- **Project API Key**: Grants access to resources specific to the project for which the key was created. [Learn how to generate API Keys](/how-to-guides/how-to-generate-api-keys)

While **Project API Keys** are restricted to project-specific resources, **Partner API Keys** provide broader access across all available resources.

## Authentication

To authenticate requests, include the API key in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token. The format is as follows:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <API Key>
```

This ensures secure authentication for API requests, with access based on the type of API key used.


**Example: Using a Partner API Key**

A **Partner API Key** can perform all actions that a **Project API Key** can, plus additional partner-level operations. For example, to list all organizations accessible by the partner:

```http
GET api/v1/organizations
Authorization: Bearer <Partner API Key>
```
This returns all organizations and related resources the partner has access to.

You can also use a **Partner API Key** to access endpoints scoped to a specific project. For example, to list catalogs within a project:
```http
GET api/v1/data/projects/{projectId}/catalogs
Authorization: Bearer <Partner API Key>
```
This returns data catalogs associated only with that project.



**Example: Using a Project API Key**

You can use a **Project API Key** to access endpoints scoped to a specific project. (Whenever you see `projects/{projectId}` in the path of an endpoint, it is scoped to the project.)

For example, to list catalogs within a project:

```http
GET api/v1/data/projects/{projectId}/catalogs
Authorization: Bearer <Project API Key>
```

Replace `{projectId}` with the ID of your project.

This returns data catalogs associated only with that project.
