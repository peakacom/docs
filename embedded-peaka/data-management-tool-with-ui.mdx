### Prerequisites

- Partner API Key: To create a Partner API Key, please refer to our guide on [managing partner API keys](https://docs.peaka.com/how-to-guides/how-to-manage-partner-api-key#how-to-manage-your-partner-api-key).

## Initiate the Session

- To begin, you need to initiate a session with Peaka using your Partner API Key as the token.

<CodeGroup>
    ```javascript cURL
    curl --request POST \
      --url https://partner.peaka.studio/api/v1/ui/initSession \
      --header 'Content-Type: application/json' 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'\
      --data '{
        "projectId": <your_project_id>
      }'
    ```
    ```javascript JavaScript
    const options = {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
      body: '{"projectId":"projectId"}'
    };

    fetch('https://partner.peaka.studio/api/v1/ui/initSession', options)
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(response => console.log(response))
      .catch(err => console.error(err));
    ```
    ```python Python
    import requests

    url = "https://partner.peaka.studio/api/v1/ui/initSession"

    payload = {
        "projectId": "projectId",
    }
    headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"}

    response = requests.request("POST", url, json=payload, headers=headers)

    print(response.text)
    ```
    ```php PHP
    <?php

      $curl = curl_init();

      curl_setopt_array($curl, [
        CURLOPT_URL => "https://partner.peaka.studio/api/v1/ui/initSession",
        CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER => true,
        CURLOPT_ENCODING => "",
        CURLOPT_MAXREDIRS => 10,
        CURLOPT_TIMEOUT => 30,
        CURLOPT_HTTP_VERSION => CURL_HTTP_VERSION_1_1,
        CURLOPT_CUSTOMREQUEST => "POST",
        CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS => "{\n \"projectId\": \"projectId\" \n}",
        CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER => [
          "Content-Type: application/json"
        ],
      ]);

      $response = curl_exec($curl);
      $err = curl_error($curl);

      curl_close($curl);

      if ($err) {
        echo "cURL Error #:" . $err;
      } else {
        echo $response;
      }
    ```
    ```go Go

    package main

    import (
      "fmt"
      "strings"
      "net/http"
      "io/ioutil"
    )

    func main() {

      url := "https://partner.peaka.studio/api/v1/ui/initSession"

      payload := strings.NewReader("{\n  \"projectId\": \"projectId\" \n}")

      req, _ := http.NewRequest("POST", url, payload)

      req.Header.Add("Content-Type", "application/json")

      res, _ := http.DefaultClient.Do(req)

      defer res.Body.Close()
      body, _ := ioutil.ReadAll(res.Body)

      fmt.Println(res)
      fmt.Println(string(body))

    }
    ```
    ```java JAVA
    HttpResponse<String> response = Unirest.post("https://partner.peaka.studio/api/v1/ui/initSession")
    .header("Content-Type", "application/json")
    .body("{\"projectId\": \"projectId\"}")
    .asString();
    ```

</CodeGroup>

- The endpoint will provide a URL to initiate your session.

```javascript
{
  "sessionUrl": "https://partner.peaka.studio/api/v1/ui/session?code=<session_code>"
  "partnerOrigin": "https://<partner_origin>.peaka.studio/"
}
```

You can access the user interface using the provided URL.

## Enabling Embedded UI for Peaka Integration Using an iframe

For security reasons, you cannot use the session URL directly in an iframe. To embed Peaka within an iframe, you need to enable the embedded UI for your partner API key.

In order to do that you should;

- Go to `Developer Settings` in your peaka account.

  <img
    src="https://cdn.peaka.com/how-to-guides/embed-ui-1.png"
    style={{ border: "1px solid #e2e4e7" }}
  />

- Find your api key in the table then click `...` button.

  <img
    src="https://cdn.peaka.com/how-to-guides/embed-ui-2.png"
    style={{ border: "1px solid #e2e4e7" }}
  />

- Select `Enable Embedded UI` option

  <img
    src="https://cdn.peaka.com/how-to-guides/embed-ui-3.png"
    style={{ border: "1px solid #e2e4e7" }}
  />

- Enable Embedded UI for this API Key

  <img
    src="https://cdn.peaka.com/how-to-guides/embed-ui-4.png"
    style={{ border: "1px solid #e2e4e7" }}
  />

- Enter your domain that you want to embed the Peaka app.

  <img
    src="https://cdn.peaka.com/how-to-guides/embed-ui-5.png"
    style={{ border: "1px solid #e2e4e7" }}
  />

  <Warning>
    URL is needed for security reasons. Please be aware that your application
    should be served over HTTPS for use in an iframe.
  </Warning>

- Enter a Company Name for white labeling in Embedded UI.

  <img
    src="https://cdn.peaka.com/how-to-guides/embed-ui-7.png"
    style={{ border: "1px solid #e2e4e7" }}
  />

- If you want to customize the UI, click "Customize UI Theme" button then give a theme name and upload your custom css file. You can also download the valid example of the customization file (Check out the related documentation [to learn more about customization](/how-to-guides/how-to-customize-embedded-ui-style)).
  You can add custom css files more than one and change themes in runtime.

  <img
    src="https://cdn.peaka.com/how-to-guides/embed-ui-6.png"
    style={{ border: "1px solid #e2e4e7" }}
  />

  After you set the css file, you should start the session with following parameters to enable custom theme.

  ```json
    {
      projectId: <your_project_id>
      theme: <your_theme_name>,
      themeOverride: true
    }
  ```

Now you are ready to embed Peaka's UI into your web application using an iframe.

```html
<iframe src="<your_session_url>" />
```

<Warning>
Note: If you want to switch between different themes in runtime you can do it with iframe's post message method.

```javascript
  iframeElement.contentWindow.postMessage(
    {
      theme: <your_theme_name>
      themeOverride: true,
    },
    partnerOrigin: <your_partner_origin>
  );
```

</Warning>
Congratulations! You have successfully embedded Peaka's UI into your web application. Your users can now seamlessly interact with Peaka's interface to manage their data efficiently and effectively.

## Hiding Parts of the Embedded UI

In **Embedded Mode**, you can customize the Peaka UI by hiding specific components or features. To do this, use the `featureFlags` key when initiating the UI session. This allows you to tailor the interface to your application’s needs, ensuring a seamless and focused user experience.

### Example:

When initializing the UI session, specify the features you want to hide or disable using the `featureFlags` configuration. This ensures that only the relevant parts of the UI are displayed to your users. For example you can hide **queries** sections in Peaka's UI with following configuration.

```javascript
curl --request POST \
  --url https://partner.peaka.studio/api/v1/ui/initSession \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'\
  --data '{
    "projectId": <your_project_id>
    "theme": <your_theme_name>,
    "themeOverride": true,
    "featureFlags": {
      "queries": false,
    }
}'
```

For more details, refer to the [Embedded API Reference](https://docs.peaka.com/api-reference/embedded-peaka-api/init-session).

## Peaka as a Connector-Only Solution

When you need to use Peaka exclusively as a connector solution, you can configure the UI session to display only the connector functionality. This streamlined approach is perfect for applications that focus on data source connections without requiring the full Peaka studio experience.

First, initialize the session with following payload options:

```javascript
curl --request POST \
  --url https://partner.peaka.studio/api/v1/ui/initSession \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'\
  --data '{
    "projectId": <your_project_id>
    "theme": <your_theme_name>,
    "themeOverride": true,
    "sessionMode": <"CONNECTOR_MODAL_ONLY" | "FULL_STUDIO">,
    "connectorType": <connector_type>,
    "catalogCreateEnabled": true,
}'
```

### Configuration Options:

**SessionMode**: Specifies the mode of the session. Available options are:

**ConnectorType**: Specifies the type of connector interface to display. Available options can be found in the [API Reference](https://docs.peaka.com/api-reference/embedded-peaka-api/init-session#body-feature-configs).

**CatalogCreateEnabled**: Boolean flag that controls whether catalogs are automatically created when establishing connections. The default value is `true`. Set this to `false` only when using `CONNECTOR_MODAL_ONLY` mode to prevent automatic catalog creation.

- `CONNECTOR_MODAL_ONLY`
- `FULL_STUDIO`

Note: **ConnectorType** and **CatalogCreateEnabled** are only available in the `CONNECTOR_MODAL_ONLY` mode.

### Example:

The API response includes `sessionUrl` and `partnerOrigin` properties, allowing you to open the Peaka interface in a popup window for seamless integration.

In this example, we're using the `CONNECTOR_MODAL_ONLY` mode to display only the connector modal interface. We get the session URL and partner origin from the API response and open the Peaka interface in a popup window.

```javascript
fetch(`https://partner.peaka.studio/api/v1/ui/initSession`, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": "Bearer <token>"
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    projectId: <your_project_id>,
    theme: <your_theme_name>,
    themeOverride: true,
    sessionMode: "CONNECTOR_MODAL_ONLY",
    connectorType: <connector_type>,
    catalogCreateEnabled: true,
  }),
}).then(async (response) => {
  const res = await response.json();

  // Open the Peaka connector interface in a popup window
  window.open(
    res.sessionUrl,
    "authPopup",
    `width=500,height=600,left=${window.screen.width / 2 - 500 / 2},top=${
      window.screen.height / 2 - 600 / 2
    },resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes,noopener=no,noreferrer=no`
  );

  // Handle the message from the Peaka connector popup
  const handleMessage = (event) => {
    // Use event.data to get the message from the Peaka connector popup when popup is closed
    if (event.data.status) {
      // Status might be "CANCELLED" or "FINISHED"
      // If popup is closed without selection a catalog, status will be "CANCELLED"
      // If popup is closed with selection a catalog, status will be "FINISHED"
      console.log("Status from the Peaka connector popup:", event.data.status);
      window.removeEventListener("message", handleMessage);
    } else {
      console.log("Data from the Peaka connector popup:", event.data);
    }
  };

  // Listen to the message from the Peaka connector popup when popup is closed
  window.addEventListener("message", handleMessage);
});
```

### Troubleshooting

If you are having trouble with having status from the connector popup, follow these steps to troubleshoot the issue:

- Check if you have enabled Embedded UI Settings for your API Key.
- Add your domain that you want to embed the Peaka app to the Embedded UI Settings in the Developer Settings.
