## Initiate the Session

- To begin, you need to initiate a session with Peaka using your Partner API Key as the token.

<CodeGroup>
    ```javascript cURL
    curl --request POST \
      --url https://partner.peaka.studio/api/v1/ui/initSession \
      --header 'Content-Type: application/json' 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'\
      --data '{
        "projectId": <your_project_id>
      }'
    ```
    ```javascript JavaScript
    const options = {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
      body: '{"projectId":"projectId"}'
    };

    fetch('https://partner.peaka.studio/api/v1/ui/initSession', options)
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(response => console.log(response))
      .catch(err => console.error(err));
    ```
    ```python Python
    import requests

    url = "https://partner.peaka.studio/api/v1/ui/initSession"

    payload = {
        "projectId": "projectId",
    }
    headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"}

    response = requests.request("POST", url, json=payload, headers=headers)

    print(response.text)
    ```
    ```php PHP
    <?php

      $curl = curl_init();

      curl_setopt_array($curl, [
        CURLOPT_URL => "https://partner.peaka.studio/api/v1/ui/initSession",
        CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER => true,
        CURLOPT_ENCODING => "",
        CURLOPT_MAXREDIRS => 10,
        CURLOPT_TIMEOUT => 30,
        CURLOPT_HTTP_VERSION => CURL_HTTP_VERSION_1_1,
        CURLOPT_CUSTOMREQUEST => "POST",
        CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS => "{\n \"projectId\": \"projectId\" \n}",
        CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER => [
          "Content-Type: application/json"
        ],
      ]);

      $response = curl_exec($curl);
      $err = curl_error($curl);

      curl_close($curl);

      if ($err) {
        echo "cURL Error #:" . $err;
      } else {
        echo $response;
      }
    ```
    ```go Go

    package main

    import (
      "fmt"
      "strings"
      "net/http"
      "io/ioutil"
    )

    func main() {

      url := "https://partner.peaka.studio/api/v1/ui/initSession"

      payload := strings.NewReader("{\n  \"projectId\": \"projectId\" \n}")

      req, _ := http.NewRequest("POST", url, payload)

      req.Header.Add("Content-Type", "application/json")

      res, _ := http.DefaultClient.Do(req)

      defer res.Body.Close()
      body, _ := ioutil.ReadAll(res.Body)

      fmt.Println(res)
      fmt.Println(string(body))

    }
    ```
    ```java JAVA
    HttpResponse<String> response = Unirest.post("https://partner.peaka.studio/api/v1/ui/initSession")
    .header("Content-Type", "application/json")
    .body("{\"projectId\": \"projectId\"}")
    .asString();
    ```

</CodeGroup>

- The endpoint will provide a URL to initiate your session.

```javascript
{
  "sessionUrl": "https://partner.peaka.studio/api/v1/ui/session?code=<session_code>"
  "partnerOrigin": "https://<partner_origin>.peaka.studio/"
}
```

You can access the user interface using the provided URL.

## Enabling Embedded UI for Peaka Integration Using an iframe

For security reasons, you cannot use the session URL directly in an iframe. To embed Peaka within an iframe, you need to enable the embedded UI for your partner API key.

In order to do that you should;

- Go to `Developer Settings` in your peaka account.

  <img
    src="https://cdn.peaka.com/how-to-guides/embed-ui-1.png"
    style={{ border: "1px solid #e2e4e7" }}
  />

- Find your api key in the table then click `...` button.

  <img
    src="https://cdn.peaka.com/how-to-guides/embed-ui-2.png"
    style={{ border: "1px solid #e2e4e7" }}
  />

- Select `Enable Embedded UI` option

  <img
    src="https://cdn.peaka.com/how-to-guides/embed-ui-3.png"
    style={{ border: "1px solid #e2e4e7" }}
  />

- Enable Embedded UI for this API Key

  <img
    src="https://cdn.peaka.com/how-to-guides/embed-ui-4.png"
    style={{ border: "1px solid #e2e4e7" }}
  />

- Enter your domain that you want to embed the Peaka app.

  <img
    src="https://cdn.peaka.com/how-to-guides/embed-ui-5.png"
    style={{ border: "1px solid #e2e4e7" }}
  />

  <Warning>
    URL is needed for security reasons. Please be aware that your application
    should be served over HTTPS for use in an iframe.
  </Warning>

- If you want to customize the UI, click "Customize UI Theme" button then give a theme name and upload your custom css file. You can also download the valid example of the customization file ([See more about customization](/how-to-guides/how-to-customize-embedded-ui-style)).
  You can add custom css files more than one and change themes in runtime.

  <img
    src="https://cdn.peaka.com/how-to-guides/embed-ui-6.png"
    style={{ border: "1px solid #e2e4e7" }}
  />

  After you set the css file, you should start the session with following parameters to enable custom theme.

  ```json
    {
      projectId: <your_project_id>
      theme: <your_theme_name>,
      themeOverride: true
    }
  ```

Now you are ready to embed Peaka's UI into your web application using an iframe.

```html
<iframe src="<your_session_url>" />
```

<Warning>
Note: If you want to switch between different themes in runtime you can do it with iframe's post message method.

```javascript
  iframeElement.contentWindow.postMessage(
    {
      theme: <your_theme_name>
      themeOverride: true,
    },
    partnerOrigin: <your_partner_origin>
  );
```

</Warning>
Congratulations! You have successfully embedded Peaka's UI into your web application. Your users can now seamlessly interact with Peaka's interface to manage their data efficiently and effectively.

## Hiding Parts of the Embedded UI

In **Embedded Mode**, you can customize the Peaka UI by hiding specific components or features. To do this, use the `featureFlags` key when initiating the UI session. This allows you to tailor the interface to your applicationâ€™s needs, ensuring a seamless and focused user experience.

### Example:

When initializing the UI session, specify the features you want to hide or disable using the `featureFlags` configuration. This ensures that only the relevant parts of the UI are displayed to your users. For example you can hide **queries** sections in Peaka's UI with following configuration.

```javascript
curl --request POST \
  --url https://partner.peaka.studio/api/v1/ui/initSession \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'\
  --data '{
    "projectId": <your_project_id>
    "theme": <your_theme_name>,
    "themeOverride": true,
    "featureFlags": {
      "queries": false,
    }
}'
```
