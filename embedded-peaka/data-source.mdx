## Step-by-Step Implementation

### 1. Create a Peaka Project

- Before you start, you need to login to your Peaka account. If you don't have an account, you can sign up for a free trial [here](https://peaka.studio/signup).

- After you login, click on the "Create New Project" button.

/>

- Your project will be created and you will be redirected to the project page.

For detailed guidance, please refer to the [Create Project documentation](https://docs.peaka.com/project-operations/how-to-create-a-project).

### 2. Create a Catalog

Once you are redirected to the project page, locate and click the plus button on the right side panel to initiate the catalog creation process.

- From the list of available options, select the catalog you wish to connect to.

  alt="Select Catalog"
/>

- Fill in the catalog name along with any other required fields to ensure proper configuration.

- After entering the necessary information, click on the "Create" or "Sign In" button to finalize the process.

- Your catalog will be successfully created, and you can start managing your data within it.

For detailed guidance, please refer to the [Create Catalog documentation](https://docs.peaka.com/connecting-your-data/add-connection).

### 3. Caching

Once you have created the catalog, you will find the catalog table displayed in the right side panel under the "Tables" section.

- Hover over the catalog item and click on the three dots icon to reveal a dropdown menu. From this menu, select the "Start Cache" option.

/>

- A modal will appear prompting you to confirm the caching action. Click on the "Start Cache" button within this modal.

**Note**: This action may either initiate a cache job for the catalog directly or open a new modal where you can input the required fields. If prompted, fill in the necessary information and then click on the "Start Cache" button to proceed.

- This will initiate the caching process for your catalog.

### 4. Creating Partner API Key

- Before starting execution of query, you need to create a Partner API key. You will use this API key to authenticate your requests to the Peaka API.

- Navigate to the [Developer](https://peaka.studio/home/advanced-settings) section.

- Click on the Partner API Key button to open a dialog box.

- Fill in the form by entering your desired API Key Name.

- Click on the Create button.

- You can copy the API key from the dialog box.

For detailed guidance, please refer to the [Create Project documentation](https://docs.peaka.com/how-to-guides/how-to-manage-partner-api-key#creating-a-partner-api-key).

### 5. Run Your Query

- Last step is to run your query.

- After running query is completed, you will get the data in response. You can use this data for further processing or analysis as needed.

For detailed guidance, please refer to the [Run Query documentation](https://docs.peaka.com/api-reference/data->-queries/execute-query).
