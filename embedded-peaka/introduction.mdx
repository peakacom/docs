Embedded Peaka enables you to integrate Peaka seamlessly into your system, unlocking robust features such as **caching, semantic catalogs, query materialization,** and more. Depending on your needs, there are three distinct ways to embed Peaka:

* **As a Data Source**: Use Peaka to connect and access data directly within your system.

* **As a Data Management Backend**: Leverage Peaka’s backend capabilities to manage and optimize your data workflows.

* **As a Complete Data Management Solution**: Implement Peaka along with its user interface for comprehensive data management.

Let’s explore the different use cases and how Peaka provides tailored solutions to address these challenges.

# Peaka as a Data Source

Peaka can serve as a **single data source** that consolidates data from multiple sources. By integrating with Peaka’s endpoints, you can query all your data directly through Peaka. This allows you to:

* Access and query multiple data sources seamlessly.

* Simplify your integration process with a single, straightforward connection.

For more information, see the [Data Source](/embedded-peaka/data-source) section.

# Peaka as a Data Management Backend

Peaka can function as a **data management backend**, enabling you to:

* Manage your data sources and data catalogs.

* Create projects and catalogs.

* Connect third-party services.

* Cache data for improved performance.
