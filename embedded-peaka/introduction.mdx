Embedded Peaka lets you integrate Peaka with your system and use features like cache, semantic catalogs, query materialization, etc.
You can embed Peaka into your system in three ways: as a data source, as a data management backend, and as a complete solution of data management with a user interface.
Let's dive into the different use cases for different needs and solutions of Peaka to these problems.
#Peaka as a Data Source
You can use Peaka as a single data source that joins multiple data from multiple sources. Then, you can integrate with Peaka's endpoints to query all your data directly from Peaka. With that, you will query multiple data sources with a single simple integration.
#Peaka as a Data Management Backend

#Peaka as a Data Management Tool with UI
