Embedded Peaka allows you to seamlessly integrate Peaka into your system, unlocking powerful features such as **caching**, **semantic catalogs**, **query materialization**, and more. You can embed Peaka in three distinct ways, depending on your needs:

- **As a Data Source**: Use Peaka to connect and access data directly within your system.  
- **As a Data Management Backend**: Leverage Peaka’s backend capabilities to manage and optimize your data workflows.  
- **As a Complete Data Management Solution**: Implement Peaka with its user interface for end-to-end data management.  

Let’s explore the different use cases and how Peaka provides tailored solutions to address these challenges.

# Peaka as a Data Source

Peaka can serve as a **single data source** that consolidates data from multiple sources. By integrating with Peaka’s endpoints, you can query all your data directly through Peaka. This allows you to:

- Access and query multiple data sources seamlessly.
- Simplify your integration process with a single, straightforward connection.

For more information, see [Data Source](/embedded-peaka/data-source).

# Peaka as a Data Management Backend

Peaka can function as a **data management backend**, enabling you to:

- Manage your data sources and data catalogs.
- Create projects and catalogs.
- Connect third-party services.
- Cache data for improved performance.

For more details, refer to the [Data Management Backend](/embedded-peaka/data-management-backend).

# Peaka as a Complete Data Management Solution

Embedded Peaka allows you to integrate Peaka’s features into your own application through flexible integration options. You can use Peaka’s UI components and tools to enhance your application’s data management capabilities.
