## **Prerequisites**

To setup CDC between your Oracle database and Peaka Big Table, you need:

- Oracle Database (12c, 19c, 21c)
- Oracle administrative permissions (SYSDBA)

## **Setup Instructions**

### Preparing the database

**Configuration needed for Oracle LogMiner**

Create a database user for Peaka's exclusive use that can perform CDC operations.

(Although, by default, SYSDBA users have all necessary privileges, you can create another user that has the minimum required privileges.)

To provide a user with CDC permissions, grant the following privileges to the user:

```sql
    CONNECT sys/<password> AS SYSDBA

    GRANT CREATE SESSION TO <username>;
    GRANT EXECUTE_CATALOG_ROLE TO <username>;
    GRANT SELECT ON V_$DATABASE TO <username>;
    GRANT FLASHBACK ANY TABLE TO <username>;
    GRANT SELECT ANY TABLE TO <username>;
    GRANT EXECUTE_CATALOG_ROLE TO <username>;
    GRANT SELECT ANY TRANSACTION TO <username>;
    GRANT LOGMINING TO <username>;
    GRANT CREATE SESSION TO <username>;
    GRANT EXECUTE_CATALOG_ROLE TO <username>;
    GRANT SELECT ON V_$DATABASE TO <username>;
    GRANT FLASHBACK ANY TABLE TO <username>;
    GRANT SELECT ANY TABLE TO <username>;
    GRANT EXECUTE_CATALOG_ROLE TO <username>;
    GRANT SELECT ANY TRANSACTION TO <username>;
    GRANT LOGMINING TO <username>;
    GRANT CREATE TABLE TO <username>;
    GRANT LOCK ANY TABLE TO <username>;
    GRANT CREATE SEQUENCE TO <username>;
    GRANT EXECUTE ON DBMS_LOGMNR TO <username>;
    GRANT EXECUTE ON DBMS_LOGMNR_D TO <username>;
    GRANT SELECT ON V_$LOG TO <username>;
    GRANT SELECT ON V_$LOG_HISTORY TO <username>;
    GRANT SELECT ON V_$LOGMNR_LOGS TO <username>;
    GRANT SELECT ON V_$LOGMNR_CONTENTS TO <username>;
    GRANT SELECT ON V_$LOGMNR_PARAMETERS TO <username>;
    GRANT SELECT ON V_$LOGFILE TO <username>;
    GRANT SELECT ON V_$ARCHIVED_LOG TO <username>;
    GRANT SELECT ON V_$ARCHIVE_DEST_STATUS TO <username>;
    GRANT SELECT ON V_$TRANSACTION TO <username>;
    GRANT SELECT ON V_$MYSTAT TO <username>;
    GRANT SELECT ON V_$STATNAME TO <username>;

    EXIT;
```

**Note**: The connector captures database changes that are made by its own Oracle user account. However, it does not capture changes that are made by the `SYS` or `SYSTEM` user accounts.

**Enable supplemental logging for the tables you want to replicate**

## Configure Oracle Database for CDC

1. Enable ARCHIVELOG mode for the database:

```sql
    CONNECT sys/<password> AS SYSDBA

    ALTER SYSTEM SET db_recovery_file_dest_size = 10G;
    ALTER SYSTEM SET db_recovery_file_dest = '/opt/oracle/oradata/recovery_area' scope=spfile;
    SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE;
    STARTUP MOUNT;
    ALTER DATABASE ARCHIVELOG;
    ALTER DATABASE OPEN;

    -- Should now "Database log mode: Archive Mode"
    ARCHIVE LOG LIST

    EXIT;
```

2. Enable supplemental logging at the database level:

```sql
   ALTER DATABASE ADD SUPPLEMENTAL LOG DATA;
```

3. Enable minimal supplemental logging for the tables you want to monitor:

```sql
   ALTER TABLE <schema>.<table> ADD SUPPLEMENTAL LOG DATA (ALL) COLUMNS;
```

**Note**: You need to enable supplemental logging for each table you want to monitor with CDC.

## Schemas excluded from capture

When the Debezium Oracle connector captures tables, it automatically excludes tables from the following schemas:

- `appqossys`
- `audsys`
- `ctxsys`
- `dvsys`
- `dbsfwuser`
- `dbsnmp`
- `qsmadmin_internal`
- `lbacsys`
- `mdsys`
- `ojvmsys`
- `olapsys`
- `orddata`
- `ordsys`
- `outln`
- `sys`
- `system`
- `vecsys`Â (Oracle 23+)
- `wmsys`
- `xdb`

To enable the connector to capture changes from a table, the table must use a schema that is not named in the preceding list.
