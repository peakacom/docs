This article provides a step-by-step guide on how to join the data from a connector with the data from a Peaka Table and use the result in your Peaka application.

## Prerequisites

Before joining data from a connector and a Peaka Table, ensure that you have the necessary data sources available. You will need:

1. **Peaka Table:** If you don't have a Peaka Table yet, you can create one by following this [guide](https://www.peaka.com/docs/connecting-your-data/creating-peaka-table/).

2. **Connector data:** You should have data from a connector source. If you don't have any connector data, you can connect your data using a SaaS connector with the help of this [article](https://www.peaka.com/docs/connecting-your-data/add-connection/).

## Step-by-step Guide

Follow these steps to join and use the data from your connector and Peaka Table:

1. **Create an SQL query:** You'll need to create a SQL query that combines data from your connector and Peaka Table. If you're unsure how to create a SQL query, refer to this [guide](https://www.peaka.com/docs/connecting-your-data/creating-query).

2. **Execute the query:** Execute the SQL query you've created. This query will merge the data from your connector and Peaka Table.

3. **View the combined data:** After executing the query, you can view the combined data. The result will display data from both your connector and Peaka Table.
