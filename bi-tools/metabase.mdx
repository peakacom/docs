Metabase has both hosted service and on-premise offerings. We will walkthrough setup process for the both version.

## Metabase Cloud Setup

You need 2 steps to complete Metabase Cloud setup:

- Generate Peaka API Key
- Setup Peaka Integration with Starburst Connector

### Generate Peaka API Key

After you create your project, setup connections and create your catalogs in Peaka, you need to generate a Peaka API Key to use it with Metabase Connector.
Check out Peaka Documentation for creating your API Key and follow detailed instructions by clicking [here](https://docs.peaka.com/how-to-guides/how-to-generate-api-keys).

### Setup Peaka Integration with Startburst Connector

The Peaka Metabase integration uses the Starburst Connector right now. Startburst Connector is offical partner driver which is provided in Metabase Cloud offering.

- In order to add Peaka as data source, go to your Metabase Home page. Click settings icon on the top right corner of the screen and click _Admin Settings_ button as shown in the screenshot below.
