This guide explains how to connect your ServiceTitan account to Peaka in order to access and analyze your ServiceTitan data within the Peaka platform.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following credentials from ServiceTitan:

- **Tenant** (Tenant ID)
- **Application Key**
- **Client ID**
- **Client Secret**

\_You can obtain the Application Key, Client ID, and Client Secret by registering your app on [developer.servicetitan.io](https://developer.servicetitan.io/). The Tenant ID identifies your ServiceTitan account and can be found in the API Applications section of your ServiceTitan account. It often matches your ServiceTitan subdomain (for example, yourcompany.servicetitan.io).

Follow these steps to obtain them:

ServiceTitan uses two different environments during the integration process:

- Developer Portal (Production credentials): Used to create the application and generate the Application Key.
- Integration Environment: Used to connect the application to your tenant and generate the Client ID and Client Secret.

1. Begin by signing into your ServiceTitan Developer account using your Production Environment credentials. Access the login portal [here](https://developer.servicetitan.io/signin/).

2. Once logged in, proceed to create a new application within the ServiceTitan developer portal.

3. Click the "New App" button to open the application creation form, where you'll need to provide your app's configuration details.

4. In the "Client Credentials Management" section, make sure to select the "Tenant will configure the credentials themselves" option. This is required so that each ServiceTitan tenant can authorize the application individually and generate their own Client ID and Client Secret.

5. After submitting the form, you'll be redirected to the app listing screen. Select your app from the list to find your Application Key. You will use this key later when creating the ServiceTitan data source in Peaka.
