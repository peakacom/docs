This article guides you through the process of connecting Amazon RDS to Peaka, allowing you to seamlessly access your Amazon RDS data within the Peaka platform.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, you will need to obtain certain values, which you can get from Amazon RDS.

Peaka now supports three different databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MariaDB. You can select any of these options. If you switch to "Aurora," your database will remain on Amazon instances. This option is only available for MySQL and PostgreSQL databases.

You need to select your AWS region and enter the URL and port. For a PostgreSQL database, you also need to enter the database name. You can obtain these values from your Amazon account.

You can authenticate using one of three methods: IAM, Secret Manager, or Password. The requirements are as follows:

**IAM**: User Name, AWS Access Key, and AWS Secret Key. Check this [article](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/database-authentication.html) to get credentials.

**Password**: User Name and Password. Check this [article](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/database-authentication.html) to get credentials.
