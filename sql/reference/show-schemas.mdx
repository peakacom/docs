title: SHOW SCHEMAS
---

## Synopsis

```sql
SHOW SCHEMAS [ FROM catalog ] [ LIKE pattern ]
```

## Description

List the schemas in `catalog` or in the current catalog.

Specify a pattern `<like-operator>` in the optional `LIKE` clause to
filter the results to the desired subset. For example, the following query
allows you to find schemas that have `3` as the third character:

```sql
SHOW SCHEMAS FROM tpch LIKE '__3%'
```
