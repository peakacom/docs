This article provides an overview of key components in Flow, including action nodes, triggers, parameters, and outputs.

## Triggers

Triggers are events that initiate the execution of a flow. They can include actions like 'On Click,' 'On Mouse Leave,' or 'On Load.' When a user triggers the specified event, the associated flow is activated.

## Action Nodes

Action nodes represent the tasks or actions that you want to perform when a trigger event occurs. In Peaka, we offer a wide range of action nodes that you can incorporate into your flows to customize their behavior.

## Outputs

Outputs are the results or data generated by action nodes during their execution. You can retrieve and utilize these outputs in subsequent action nodes or other parts of your flow to achieve your desired outcomes.
