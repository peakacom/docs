## Creating Global Variables

When you use the 'Set Variable' node to create a global variable, it becomes accessible and usable throughout your entire application. You can set its initial value, and it retains its value between different pages and interactions.

## Creating Page Variables

Page variables, on the other hand, are specific to the current page of your application. They are ideal for storing temporary or context-specific data that is only relevant within the scope of the current page.
