## Introduction

Ever wanted to give your AI assistant the power to manage entire data platforms, create connections to databases, and execute complex queries across multiple data sources?

With Peaka's API MCP Server, you can transform any MCP-compatible AI assistant into a powerful data management tool that understands your infrastructure, connects to various data sources, and helps you build comprehensive data solutions without writing a single line of integration code.

In this blog, I'll show you how to set up and use Peaka's API MCP Server to unlock the full potential of AI-powered data management.

## What is an MCP Server?

While AI assistants are great at understanding and generating text, they often need external tools to interact with real systems like databases, APIs, or data platforms. That's where MCP servers shine.

MCP stands for Model Context Protocol. An MCP server is a standardized interface that exposes tools or data sources to AI assistants. The assistant doesn't need to know the intricacies of how a specific API works or where services are hosted.

For example, Peaka's API MCP server provides comprehensive access to Peaka's most of API endpoints, including:

- **Complete API Documentation**: URLs, endpoints, HTTP methods, and parameters
- **Authentication Details**: Headers, authorization rules, and API key management
- **Request/Response Examples**: Sample payloads and expected returns
- **Error Handling**: Status codes and troubleshooting guidance

## Prerequisites

To get started with Peaka's API MCP Server, you'll need:

- **Peaka Partner API Key**: Access to Peaka's comprehensive API endpoints. Get yours from the [Partner API Key Management Guide](https://docs.peaka.com/how-to-guides/how-to-manage-partner-api-key).
- **MCP-Compatible AI Assistant**: Such as [Claude Desktop](https://www.anthropic.com/products/claude-desktop) or [Cursor IDE](https://www.cursor.com/)

## What You Can Do with Peaka's API MCP Server

Once connected, your AI assistant becomes a comprehensive API development companion. Here's what becomes possible:

### 1. API Discovery and Documentation

```
"Show me all available Peaka APIs for managing database connections"
```

Your assistant will provide:

- Complete list of connection-related endpoints
- Required parameters and headers for each API
- Authentication requirements and formats
- Sample request/response payloads
- Error codes and troubleshooting tips

### 2. Code Generation for Any Language

```
"Generate JavaScript code to create a new Peaka project using the API with given organization ID and workspace ID"
```

The assistant will create:

- Complete JavaScript script with proper imports and headers
- Correct API endpoint URLs and headers
- Authentication setup with your API key
- Error handling and response parsing

**Example output:**

```javascript
const PEAKA_API_URL = "https://partner.peaka.studio/api/v1";
const API_KEY = "your-api-key";

// Create a new Peaka project
async function createPeakaProject(organizationId, workspaceId, projectName) {
  const response = await fetch(
    `${PEAKA_API_URL}/organizations/${organizationId}/workspaces/${workspaceId}/projects`,
    {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${API_KEY}`,
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({ name: projectName }),
    }
  );

  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error(`Failed to create project: ${response.statusText}`);
  }

  return await response.json();
}

// Usage example
async function main() {
  try {
    const project = await createPeakaProject(
      "your-organization-id",
      "your-workspace-id",
      "My New Project"
    );

    console.log("Project created:", project.name);
    console.log("Project ID:", project.id);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error:", error.message);
  }
}

// Run the example
main();
```

## Real-World Development Scenarios

### 1. Building a Data Integration Script

**Developer Request**: _"I need to create a new connection to a PostgreSQL database using the API with given organization ID and workspace ID" with given details: name: "My DB", driver: "postgresql", host: "localhost"_

**AI Assistant Response**:

```javascript
const PEAKA_API_URL = "https://partner.peaka.studio/api/v1";

async function createPostgreSQLConnection(config) {
  const {
    apiKey,
    projectId,
    connectionName,
    host,
    port,
    user,
    password,
    database,
  } = config;

  // Connection payload for PostgreSQL
  const payload = {
    name: connectionName || "My PostgreSQL DB",
    type: "POSTGRES",
    credential: {
      url: host || "localhost",
      port: port || 5432,
      user: user || "postgres",
      password: password,
      databaseName: database,
      useSsl: false,
    },
  };

  // Create connection via Peaka API
  const response = await fetch(`${PEAKA_API_URL}/connections/${projectId}`, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${API_KEY}`,
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(payload),
  });

  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error(`Failed to create connection: ${response.statusText}`);
  }

  return await response.json();
}

// Example usage
async function run() {
  try {
    const connection = await createPostgreSQLConnection({
      apiKey: "your-peaka-api-key",
      projectId: "your-project-id",
      connectionName: "My DB",
      host: "localhost",
      port: 5432,
      user: "postgres",
      password: "your-password",
      database: "your-database",
    });

    console.log("✅ Connection created:", connection.id);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("❌ Error:", error.message);
  }
}

run();
```

### 2. API Error Handling and Debugging

**Developer Request**: _"My API call is failing with a 422 error. Help me understand what's wrong."_

**AI Assistant Analysis**:

- Reviews the 422 status code (Unprocessable Entity)
- Analyzes your request payload against Peaka's API schema
- Identifies missing required fields or invalid data types
- Provides corrected request with proper validation
- Suggests preventive measures for future calls
