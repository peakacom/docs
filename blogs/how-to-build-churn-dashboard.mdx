description: "Build a dashboard that identifies Pro- and Enterprise-tier subscribers who contacted support shortly before canceling their subscriptions."
---

# Project Overview

What if your high-paying customers try to tell you something before they churn, and you don’t catch it?

In this tutorial, you will build a dashboard that identifies **Pro- and Enterprise-tier subscribers who contacted support shortly before canceling** their subscriptions. The goal is to help support and product teams understand churn patterns and take action before it’s too late.

This dashboard provides real value for:

- **Customer support teams** looking to spot at-risk users,
- **Product managers** needing context around cancellations,
- **Growth and revenue teams** focused on reducing churn.

Best of all, instead of spending days coding, you will build this entire system in **just 1 hour** using **Peaka** for data integration and **v0.dev** to generate the frontend.

## The Tools You’ll Need / The Stack

Here’s what you’ll use to bring everything together:

- **Peaka** – A no-code data integration platform that connects and joins data from Stripe and Zendesk, then turns those queries into APIs you can consume.
- **v0.dev** – An AI-powered tool that generates a full-stack dashboard UI based on a simple natural language prompt.
- **Stripe + Zendesk** – The core data sources providing subscription details and customer support tickets, respectively.

---

### Why Peaka?

Peaka is a no-code data operations platform that enables you to:

- Connect to external data sources like APIs, databases, and SaaS applications,
- Model your data as **virtual tables** without moving or duplicating it,
- Create APIs on top of those virtual tables to serve your applications.

For this dashboard, Peaka provides:

- A seamless way to **connect Zendesk and Stripe data** by matching customer emails,
- A flexible query builder that lets you **join support tickets with subscription data** using SQL,
- Ready to use API endpoints that you can call directly from your app.

By using Peaka, you avoid building and maintaining a custom backend, saving significant development time and complexity.

---

### Why v0.dev?

With v0.dev, you can:

- Skip writing any frontend code. Just describe your app in a prompt,
- Get a fully functional, developer-friendly UI generated for you,
- Automatically generate backend integration logic that connects to Peaka’s APIs,
- Easily adapt your app by updating prompts or API specs and regenerating the code.

## Let's Start

### Step 1: Setting Up Your Peaka Project

Before you start building, you need to set up your Peaka workspace and generate an API key for authentication.

Follow these steps:

1. Go to [peaka.studio](https://peaka.studio/) and log in.
    > If you don’t have an account yet, sign up. It only takes a minute.
2. Create a **new project** from your dashboard.
3. Open your new project, then click the gear icon (⚙️) in the bottom left sidebar to open **Settings**.
4. In **Settings**, navigate to the **API Keys** tab and create a new API key.
5. Copy your **Project ID** from the URL in your browser’s address bar. It should look like this:

```curl
https://peaka.studio/studio/{project_id}/..
```

Save both the API key and Project ID safely, you’ll need these when connecting Peaka to v0.dev.


### Step 2: Connecting Data Sources in Peaka

With your project set up, it’s time to bring in your external data.

In this example, you’ll connect **Stripe** and **Zendesk** to Peaka. These will serve as the foundation for your churn and support analysis.

---

#### Connecting Stripe

- In your Peaka project, click the **➕ Add** button on the left sidebar to open the **Connector List**.
- Use the search bar to find **Stripe** among the available connectors.
- Select it, give the connection a name (e.g., `stripe_main`), and enter your **Stripe API Key**.
- Click **Connect,** and you’re done!
    
Your Stripe data will now appear under your connected data sources.

    ![Connecting Stripe Account](https://cdn.peaka.com/blogs/churn-analysis-dashboard/image1.png)

---

#### Connecting Zendesk

- Back in the **Connector List**, search for **Zendesk** and select it.
- Since Zendesk supports **OAuth authentication**, setup is quick and easy.
- Provide a **connection name** and your **Zendesk subdomain** (e.g., `yourcompany.zendesk.com`).
- Peaka will redirect you to Zendesk for login and authorization. Once approved, the connector will be activated.
- You’ll now have access to **Zendesk tickets and user data** within Peaka, no API handling required.

---

By the end of this step, both **Stripe** and **Zendesk** will be live in your Peaka project fully authenticated and ready to query.

### Step 3: Writing Queries in Peaka

With Stripe and Zendesk connected, it’s time to extract insights by writing queries across both data sources.

---

#### Creating a New Query in Peaka

- From the left sidebar, go to the **Queries** section.
- Click **➕ New Query** to create a new SQL query.
- Choose **Start from Scratch** instead of using a template.
    > (You can explore Peaka’s templates later for common use cases.)
- Write the following SQL queries and click **Run** to preview the results.

![Query Screen](https://cdn.peaka.com/blogs/churn-analysis-dashboard/image4.png)

---

#### Query 1: Support Tickets Submitted Shortly Before Churn

This query finds **Pro or Enterprise users** who submitted a support ticket **within 14 days before canceling** their subscription.

Use it to identify customers who might have been unhappy or struggling and possibly prevent future churn.

```sql
SELECT
  u.name,
  prod.name AS plan_name,
  z.subject,
  z.description,
  u.email AS customer_email
FROM
  "zd"."public"."tickets" z
JOIN
  "zd"."public"."users" u ON z.requester_id = u.id
JOIN
  "stripe"."payment"."customers" c ON u.email = c.email
JOIN
  "stripe"."payment"."subscriptions" sub ON c.id = sub.customer_id
JOIN
  "stripe"."payment"."plans" p ON sub.plan_id = p.id
JOIN
  "stripe"."payment"."products" prod ON p.product_id = prod.id
WHERE
  prod.name IN ('Pro Plan', 'Enterprise Plan')
  AND sub.canceled_at IS NOT NULL
  AND z.created_at BETWEEN (sub.canceled_at - INTERVAL '14' DAY) AND sub.canceled_at
ORDER BY z.created_at DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

---

#### Query 2: All Tickets from Premium Users

This query retrieves **all support tickets** submitted by **Pro and Enterprise plan** users, whether they churned or not.

It’s useful for exploring the overall support volume, issue trends, and satisfaction signals from your premium customer base.

```sql
SELECT
  u.name AS customer_name,
  prod.name AS plan_name,
  z.subject AS ticket_subject,
  z.description AS ticket_description,
  u.email AS customer_email,
  z.priority,
  z.status,
  z.updated_at
FROM
  "zd"."public"."tickets" z
JOIN
  "zd"."public"."users" u ON z.requester_id = u.id
JOIN
  "stripe"."payment"."customers" c ON u.email = c.email
JOIN
  "stripe"."payment"."subscriptions" sub ON c.id = sub.customer_id
JOIN
  "stripe"."payment"."plans" p ON sub.plan_id = p.id
JOIN
  "stripe"."payment"."products" prod ON p.product_id = prod.id
WHERE
  prod.name IN ('Pro Plan', 'Enterprise Plan')
ORDER BY z.created_at DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

### Step 4: Integrating Peaka Queries into the Frontend with v0.dev

With your Peaka queries ready, you can now build a complete frontend dashboard using [v0.dev](https://v0.dev/). This step shows how to integrate live query results into your UI, entirely through prompt-based generation.

#### Start with a Prompt

Begin by opening [v0.dev](https://v0.dev/) and entering a prompt like this:

```
I have a Peaka account and a Peaka project that contains two queries.

I want to create a dashboard with the following charts:

- A table listing users who contacted support shortly before canceling. (You can execute the tickets_by_pro_enterprise_customers query from Peaka)
- A list of recent feedback entries from premium subscribers. (You can execute the zendesk_tickets_with_stripe_customer_and_plan_info query from Peaka)

It should be a full-stack system. The design should be developer-friendly and backend should be integrated with Peaka.

You can check the API reference here: https://docs.peaka.com/api-reference/introduction
```
![v0 initial prompt](https://cdn.peaka.com/blogs/churn-analysis-dashboard/image5.png)

---

#### Set Environment Variables

v0.dev will likely ask you to define the following environment variables to authenticate with Peaka:

- `PEAKA_API_KEY`
- `PEAKA_PROJECT_ID`

Use the values you obtained earlier from your Peaka project’s settings and paste them into v0.dev’s environment configuration.

![v0 Api Key Screen](https://cdn.peaka.com/blogs/churn-analysis-dashboard/image6.png)

---

#### Fix the API Base URL

By default, v0.dev may try to connect to `https://api.peaka.com/v1`, which is not the correct base URL for query execution.

You can fix this by prompting v0.dev with:

```
API Endpoint base is different than api.peaka.com/v1.
It should be https://partner.peaka.studio/api/v1
```

If you're using the **EU zone**, use:

```
https://partner.eu.peaka.studio/api/v1
```
![Base URL Fix in v0](https://cdn.peaka.com/blogs/churn-analysis-dashboard/image7.png)

---

#### Use the Correct Request Format

After correcting the base URL, you’ll also need to make sure the request payload matches Peaka’s `execute-query` API format.

You can provide v0.dev with this sample request and response structure, based on the [official documentation](https://docs.peaka.com/api-reference/data-queries/execute-query):

**Sample request:**

```jsx
const options = {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {Authorization: 'Bearer <token>', 'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
  body: '{"from":[{"catalogName":"peaka","schemaName":"query","tableName":"samplequery"}]}'
};

fetch('https://partner.eu.peaka.studio/api/v1/data/projects/{projectId}/queries/execute', options)
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(response => console.log(response))
  .catch(err => console.error(err));
```

**Sample response:**

```json
{
  "columns": [
    {
      "catalogId": "2",
      "catalogName": "peaka",
      "schemaName": "query",
      "tableName": "samplequery",
      "columnName": "amount"
    }
  ],
  "data": [
    [
      {
        "name": "amount",
        "displayName": "amount",
        "dataType": "bigint",
        "value": "75",
        "order": 0
      }
    ],
    [
      {
        "name": "amount",
        "displayName": "amount",
        "dataType": "bigint",
        "value": "75",
        "order": 0
      }
    ],
    [
      {
        "name": "amount",
        "displayName": "amount",
        "dataType": "bigint",
        "value": "75",
        "order": 0
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

#### Final Touches via Prompt Iteration

Once your frontend is connected to Peaka and fetching live data, you can polish the UI using plain prompts.

For example:

```
Map the "date" field to the "updated_at" column in the recent feedback table, and remove the "rate" field.
```

v0.dev will apply your changes automatically, no need to manually edit code.

---

> ✅ At the end of this step, you’ll have a dynamic frontend powered by Peaka’s live query data fully operational in under an hour.

### Step 5: The Final Dashboard

After hooking up Peaka as the data layer in a [v0.dev](https://v0.dev/) dashboard, you’ll have a clean, fully functional, and developer-friendly interface, powered entirely by live data from Stripe and Zendesk.

The dashboard consists of two key components:

---

#### 1. Users Who Contacted Support Shortly Before Churning

This table lists:

- Customer name
- Email address
- Plan type (Pro or Enterprise)
- Ticket subject & description
- Ticket creation date (within 14 days before cancellation)

This component highlights **last-minute support activity** from users who churned, providing early-warning signals of dissatisfaction or friction. It’s an invaluable tool for customer support and product teams to spot trends behind cancellations.

![Support Before Cancellation screen](https://cdn.peaka.com/blogs/churn-analysis-dashboard/image9.png)

---

#### 2. Recent Feedback from Premium Subscribers

This section displays all tickets submitted by **current** Pro and Enterprise users, regardless of churn status. It includes:

- Customer name
- Plan name
- Ticket subject & description
- Ticket priority, status, and last updated date

This real-time view helps teams **monitor ongoing support needs** and stay ahead of potential churn risks before they escalate.

![Premium Subscribers' Ticket Screen](https://cdn.peaka.com/blogs/churn-analysis-dashboard/image10.png)

---

#### Why This Dashboard Delivers Value

This dashboard isn’t just a data visualization, it enables action. Here's how different teams benefit:

- **Product teams** can identify recurring friction points.
- **Support teams** can evaluate whether unresolved tickets correlate with churn.
- **Revenue & growth teams** can track churn trends across plan tiers.
- **CSMs** can proactively reach out to users showing warning signs.

---

#### Time and Effort Saved

Traditionally, building this system would require:

- Manual API integrations
- Authentication handling
- SQL joins and data modeling
- Backend service development
- Frontend component coding

…resulting in **days or even a week** of effort.

By using **Peaka + v0.dev**, the same outcome can be achieved in **under an hour**, with:

- No custom backend development
- No manual UI coding
- Just clear prompts and a few API keys

---

> 💡 This is a fast, scalable way to ship internal tools or MVPs using live SaaS data without compromising on developer experience.

## Real-World Use Cases

This exact approach can be adapted for various needs:

- **Support teams**: Proactively identify at-risk customers.
- **Product teams**: Spot recurring feedback from premium users.
- **Growth teams**: Understand why high-value customers churn.

All without hiring a data team or building internal tools from scratch.

## The Conventional Way

The traditional approach would have looked like this:

- ETL pipeline to pull data from Stripe and Zendesk,
- A data warehouse to store and query the results,
- A backend service to expose APIs,
- A frontend team to build a dashboard.

Estimated time: **2–3 days, at minimum**.

Peaka + v0? **1 hour.**

## Key Takeaways

- **Churn signals often hide in support data:** Users who reach out to support shortly before canceling are waving red flags. Surfacing these interactions helps teams take proactive action before it's too late.
- **Peaka makes integrations painless:** Connect to platforms like Stripe and Zendesk without writing any code, model the data with SQL, and instantly turn queries into APIs.
- **v0.dev eliminates frontend overhead:** With natural language prompts, you can generate fully functional dashboards that connect to live data, no UI or backend coding required.
- **1 hour = days of saved effort:** What would normally take days, building data pipelines, backend services, and frontend components, can now be achieved in under an hour.
- **Accessible for non-technical teams:** PMs, support leads, and growth managers can gain insights without needing to write a single line of code.
- **Flexible and reusable:** The same structure can be repurposed for different queries, data sources, or dashboard layouts with minimal changes.

> 🎯 Bottom line: Skip the complexity, accelerate insight.
> 
> 
> Peaka + v0.dev is a turbocharged way to build MVPs and internal tools.

## Conclusion

By simply:

- Connecting Zendesk and Stripe to Peaka,
- Writing two SQL queries,
- Prompting v0.dev to generate the frontend,

I built a fully functional, data-powered churn insight dashboard in just **1 hour**.

If you’re a developer, or even a PM who wants results without the overhead of building everything from scratch, give this combo a try.
