# Project Overview

What if your marketing teams or agencies could consolidate all their analytics data into one unified dashboard without building a connectors, storage pipelines?

In this tutorial, you will build a comprehensive multi-channel marketing analytics dashboard that consolidates data from various marketing platforms (Google Analytics, Google Ads, etc.) and embeds Peaka to seamlessly connect to all your data sources without any ETL processes.

This dashboard provides real value for:

- **Marketing teams** looking to consolidate all their analytics data into one unified dashboard,
- **Agencies** looking to provide a unified dashboard to their clients,
- **Businesses** looking to get a holistic view of their marketing performance.

Best of all, instead of spending days coding, you will build this entire system in **just 1 hour** using **Peaka** for data integration and **v0.dev** to generate the frontend.

## The Tools You’ll Need / The Stack

Here’s what you’ll use to bring everything together:

- **Peaka** – A no-code data integration platform that connects and joins data from Google Analytics, Google Ads, etc., then turns those queries into APIs you can consume.
- **v0.dev** – An AI-powered tool that generates a full-stack dashboard UI based on a simple natural language prompt.
- **Google Analytics and Google Ads** – The core data sources providing marketing analytics data.

---

### Why Peaka?

Peaka is a no-code data operations platform that enables you to:

- Connect to external data sources like APIs, databases, and SaaS applications,
- Model your data as **virtual tables** without moving or duplicating it,
- Create APIs on top of those virtual tables to serve your applications.

For this dashboard, Peaka provides:

- A seamless way to **connect Google Analytics and Google Ads** by getting your data from the sources,
- A flexible query builder that lets you **join marketing analytics data** using SQL,
- Ready to use API endpoints that you can call directly from your app.

By using Peaka, you avoid building and maintaining a custom backend, saving significant development time and complexity.

---

### Why v0.dev?

With v0.dev, you can:

- Skip writing any frontend code. Just describe your app in a prompt,
- Get a fully functional, developer-friendly UI generated for you,
- Automatically generate backend integration logic that connects to Peaka’s APIs,
- Easily adapt your app by updating prompts or API specs and regenerating the code.

## Let's Start

### Step 1: Setting Up Your Peaka Project

Before you start building, you need to set up your Peaka workspace and generate an API key for authentication.

Follow these steps:

1. Go to [peaka.studio](https://peaka.studio/) and log in.
   > If you don’t have an account yet, sign up. It only takes a minute.
2. Navigate to **Developer** section from the left sidebar.
3. Create a new **API key** by clicking the **"Partner API Key"** button.
4. After creating your **API key**, configure the **API key** to enable **Embedded Peaka**.
5. Create a **new project** from your dashboard.
6. Copy your **Project ID** from the URL in your browser’s address bar. It should look like this: https://peaka.studio/studio/{project_id}/..

```curl
https://peaka.studio/studio/{project_id}/..
```

Save both the API key and Project ID safely, you’ll need these when connecting Peaka to v0.dev.

### Step 2: Implementing the Embedded Peaka with v0.dev

```
  Create a dashboard with embedded Peaka integration that allows users to:

  1. Input their Peaka Project ID and API Token through a clean form interface
  2. Embed their Peaka project using the Embedded Peaka API, which is referenced in the documentation: https://docs.peaka.com/embedded-peaka/data-management-tool-with-ui#initiate-the-session
  3. Display a user-friendly dashboard layout

  The dashboard should include:
  - A configuration section with input fields for Project ID and API Token
  - The sessionUrl from the Embedded Peaka API response should be used as the iframe src attribute to display the embedded interface

  The UI should be modern, responsive, and follow best practices for dashboard design.

  - Sample Request:

  curl --request POST \
    --url https://partner.peaka.studio/api/v1/ui/initSession \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'\
    --data '{
      "projectId": <your_project_id>
  }'

  - Sample Response:

  {
    "sessionUrl": "https://partner.peaka.studio/api/v1/ui/session?code=<session_code>"
    "partnerOrigin": "https://<partner_origin>.peaka.studio/"
  }
```

#### Connecting Google Ads

- In your Peaka project, click the **+ Add** button on the left sidebar to open the **Connector List**.
- Use the search bar to find **Google Ads** among the available connectors.
- Select it, give the connection a name (e.g., `google_ads_main`), and enter your **Google Ads API Key**.
- Provide a **connection name** and your **Customer ID**.
- Click **Sign in with Google,** and then allow the connection.
- You’re done!

Your Google Ads data will now appear under your connected data sources.

---

#### Connecting Google Analytics

- In your Peaka project, click the **+ Add** button on the left sidebar to open the **Connector List**.
- Use the search bar to find **Google Analytics** among the available connectors.
- Select it, give the connection a name (e.g., `google_ads_main`).
- Click **Sign in with Google,** and then allow the connection.
- You’re done!

![Search Google Analytics to Connect](https://cdn.peaka.com/blogs/build-multi-channel-marketing-analytics/search-google-analytics-to-connect.png)
![Connecting Google Analytics Account](https://cdn.peaka.com/blogs/build-multi-channel-marketing-analytics/connecting-google-analytics-account.png)

---

By the end of this step, both **Google Ads** and **Google Analytics** will be live in your Peaka project fully authenticated and ready to query.

### Step 3: Writing Queries in Peaka

With Google Ads and Google Analytics connected, it’s time to extract insights by writing queries across both data sources.

---

#### Creating a New Query in Peaka

- From the left sidebar, go to the **Queries** section.
- Click **➕ New Query** to create a new SQL query.
- Choose **Start from Scratch** instead of using a template.
  > (You can explore Peaka’s templates later for common use cases.)
- Write the following SQL queries and click **Run** to preview the results.

![Query Screen](https://cdn.peaka.com/blogs/build-multi-channel-marketing-analytics/query-screen.png)

---

#### Query: Support Tickets Submitted Shortly Before Churn

This query finds **Pro or Enterprise users** who submitted a support ticket **within 14 days before canceling** their subscription.

Use it to identify customers who might have been unhappy or struggling and possibly prevent future churn.

```sql
SELECT
  u.name,
  prod.name AS plan_name,
  z.subject,
  z.description,
  u.email AS customer_email
FROM
  "zd"."public"."tickets" z
JOIN
  "zd"."public"."users" u ON z.requester_id = u.id
JOIN
  "stripe"."payment"."customers" c ON u.email = c.email
JOIN
  "stripe"."payment"."subscriptions" sub ON c.id = sub.customer_id
JOIN
  "stripe"."payment"."plans" p ON sub.plan_id = p.id
JOIN
  "stripe"."payment"."products" prod ON p.product_id = prod.id
WHERE
  prod.name IN ('Pro Plan', 'Enterprise Plan')
  AND sub.canceled_at IS NOT NULL
  AND z.created_at BETWEEN (sub.canceled_at - INTERVAL '14' DAY) AND sub.canceled_at
ORDER BY z.created_at DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### Step 4: Integrating Peaka Queries into the Frontend with v0.dev

With your Peaka queries ready, you can now build a complete frontend dashboard using [v0.dev](https://v0.dev/). This step shows how to integrate live query results into your UI, entirely through prompt-based generation.

#### Start with a Prompt

Begin by opening [v0.dev](https://v0.dev/) and entering a prompt like this:

```
I have a Peaka account and a Peaka project that contains two queries.

I want to create a dashboard with the following charts:

- A table listing users who contacted support shortly before canceling. (You can execute the tickets_by_pro_enterprise_customers query from Peaka)
- A list of recent feedback entries from premium subscribers. (You can execute the zendesk_tickets_with_stripe_customer_and_plan_info query from Peaka)

It should be a full-stack system. The design should be developer-friendly and backend should be integrated with Peaka.

You can check the API reference here: https://docs.peaka.com/api-reference/introduction
```

![v0 initial prompt](https://cdn.peaka.com/blogs/churn-analysis-dashboard/image5.png)

---

#### Set Environment Variables

v0.dev will likely ask you to define the following environment variables to authenticate with Peaka:

- `PEAKA_API_KEY`
- `PEAKA_PROJECT_ID`

Use the values you obtained earlier from your Peaka project’s settings and paste them into v0.dev’s environment configuration.

![v0 Api Key Screen](https://cdn.peaka.com/blogs/churn-analysis-dashboard/image6.png)

---

#### Fix the API Base URL

By default, v0.dev may try to connect to `https://api.peaka.com/v1`, which is not the correct base URL for query execution.

You can fix this by prompting v0.dev with:

```
API Endpoint base is different than api.peaka.com/v1.
It should be https://partner.peaka.studio/api/v1
```

If you're using the **EU zone**, use:

```
https://partner.eu.peaka.studio/api/v1
```

![Base URL Fix in v0](https://cdn.peaka.com/blogs/churn-analysis-dashboard/image7.png)

---

#### Use the Correct Request Format

After correcting the base URL, you’ll also need to make sure the request payload matches Peaka’s `execute-query` API format.

You can provide v0.dev with this sample request and response structure, based on the [official documentation](https://docs.peaka.com/api-reference/data-queries/execute-query):

**Sample request:**

```jsx
const options = {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    Authorization: "Bearer <token>",
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: '{"from":[{"catalogName":"peaka","schemaName":"query","tableName":"samplequery"}]}',
};

fetch(
  "https://partner.eu.peaka.studio/api/v1/data/projects/{projectId}/queries/execute",
  options
)
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((response) => console.log(response))
  .catch((err) => console.error(err));
```

**Sample response:**

```json
{
  "columns": [
    {
      "catalogId": "2",
      "catalogName": "peaka",
      "schemaName": "query",
      "tableName": "samplequery",
      "columnName": "amount"
    }
  ],
  "data": [
    [
      {
        "name": "amount",
        "displayName": "amount",
        "dataType": "bigint",
        "value": "75",
        "order": 0
      }
    ],
    [
      {
        "name": "amount",
        "displayName": "amount",
        "dataType": "bigint",
        "value": "75",
        "order": 0
      }
    ],
    [
      {
        "name": "amount",
        "displayName": "amount",
        "dataType": "bigint",
        "value": "75",
        "order": 0
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

#### Final Touches via Prompt Iteration

Once your frontend is connected to Peaka and fetching live data, you can polish the UI using plain prompts.

For example:

```
Map the "date" field to the "updated_at" column in the recent feedback table, and remove the "rate" field.
```

v0.dev will apply your changes automatically, no need to manually edit code.

---

> ✅ At the end of this step, you’ll have a dynamic frontend powered by Peaka’s live query data fully operational in under an hour.

### Step 5: The Final Dashboard

After hooking up Peaka as the data layer in a [v0.dev](https://v0.dev/) dashboard, you’ll have a clean, fully functional, and developer-friendly interface, powered entirely by live data from Stripe and Zendesk.

The dashboard consists of two key components:

---

#### 1. Users Who Contacted Support Shortly Before Churning

This table lists:

- Customer name
- Email address
- Plan type (Pro or Enterprise)
- Ticket subject & description
- Ticket creation date (within 14 days before cancellation)

This component highlights **last-minute support activity** from users who churned, providing early-warning signals of dissatisfaction or friction. It’s an invaluable tool for customer support and product teams to spot trends behind cancellations.

![Support Before Cancellation screen](https://cdn.peaka.com/blogs/churn-analysis-dashboard/image9.png)

---

#### 2. Recent Feedback from Premium Subscribers

This section displays all tickets submitted by **current** Pro and Enterprise users, regardless of churn status. It includes:

- Customer name
- Plan name
- Ticket subject & description
- Ticket priority, status, and last updated date

This real-time view helps teams **monitor ongoing support needs** and stay ahead of potential churn risks before they escalate.

![Premium Subscribers' Ticket Screen](https://cdn.peaka.com/blogs/churn-analysis-dashboard/image10.png)

---

#### Why This Dashboard Delivers Value

This dashboard isn’t just a data visualization, it enables action. Here's how different teams benefit:

- **Product teams** can identify recurring friction points.
- **Support teams** can evaluate whether unresolved tickets correlate with churn.
- **Revenue & growth teams** can track churn trends across plan tiers.
- **CSMs** can proactively reach out to users showing warning signs.

---

#### Time and Effort Saved

Traditionally, building this system would require:

- Manual API integrations
- Authentication handling
- SQL joins and data modeling
- Backend service development
- Frontend component coding

…resulting in **days or even a week** of effort.

By using **Peaka + v0.dev**, the same outcome can be achieved in **under an hour**, with:

- No custom backend development
- No manual UI coding
- Just clear prompts and a few API keys

---

> 💡 This is a fast, scalable way to ship internal tools or MVPs using live SaaS data without compromising on developer experience.

## Real-World Use Cases

This exact approach can be adapted for various needs:

- **Support teams**: Proactively identify at-risk customers.
- **Product teams**: Spot recurring feedback from premium users.
- **Growth teams**: Understand why high-value customers churn.

All without hiring a data team or building internal tools from scratch.

## The Conventional Way

The traditional approach would have looked like this:

- ETL pipeline to pull data from Stripe and Zendesk,
- A data warehouse to store and query the results,
- A backend service to expose APIs,
- A frontend team to build a dashboard.

Estimated time: **2–3 days, at minimum**.

Peaka + v0? **1 hour.**

## Key Takeaways

- **Churn signals often hide in support data:** Users who reach out to support shortly before canceling are waving red flags. Surfacing these interactions helps teams take proactive action before it's too late.
- **Peaka makes integrations painless:** Connect to platforms like Stripe and Zendesk without writing any code, model the data with SQL, and instantly turn queries into APIs.
- **v0.dev eliminates frontend overhead:** With natural language prompts, you can generate fully functional dashboards that connect to live data, no UI or backend coding required.
- **1 hour = days of saved effort:** What would normally take days, building data pipelines, backend services, and frontend components, can now be achieved in under an hour.
- **Accessible for non-technical teams:** PMs, support leads, and growth managers can gain insights without needing to write a single line of code.
- **Flexible and reusable:** The same structure can be repurposed for different queries, data sources, or dashboard layouts with minimal changes.

> 🎯 Bottom line: Skip the complexity, accelerate insight.
>
> Peaka + v0.dev is a turbocharged way to build MVPs and internal tools.

## Conclusion

By simply:

- Connecting Zendesk and Stripe to Peaka,
- Writing two SQL queries,
- Prompting v0.dev to generate the frontend,

I built a fully functional, data-powered churn insight dashboard in just **1 hour**.

If you’re a developer, or even a PM who wants results without the overhead of building everything from scratch, give this combo a try.
