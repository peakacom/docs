## Prerequisites

Before adding a custom LLM model, make sure you have the following ready:

- **API Key**: The authentication key issued by your LLM provider.
- **Base URL** (if applicable): The endpoint through which requests to the model will be made.

We currently support the following providers:

- OpenAI and Azure OpenAI
- Google Gemini
- Alibaba Cloud Qwen

ðŸ‘‰ If youâ€™re using another provider, let us know â€” we can add support for additional LLMs.
